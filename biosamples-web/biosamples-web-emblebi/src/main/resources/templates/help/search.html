			<h2>How to search BioSamples</h2>

			<p>In the top right corner of every page (including this one!) is
				a search box. You can enter any words that you want describe your
				samples of interest here. Once a query has been entered, press
				return or click on the "search" button to view the results.</p>
			<p>The main section of the results page is stack of samples or
				groups that match your search term. Each of them is described in
				summary, and can be clicked on to go to a dedicated page with more
				details. The results are ordered by quality of match.</p>
			<p>On the left of the side are a collection of facets that you
				can use to refine your query. Picking one or more of these will
				limit the results displayed to only those that have that specific
				attribute type and value. Once a facet has been selected, it is
				remove from the list; to de-select a facet, simply click on the
				cross displayed next to the badge at the top of the page.</p>
			<p>If there are many results for a query then they will be split
				over multiple pages; to change page, use the controls underneath the
				facets on the left.</p>

			<p>As as as simply entering the terms you wish to search for,
				there are some additional features of the search that might be
				useful to find samples of interest.</p>

			<h4>Double quotes</h4>
			<p>
				Sometimes you will want to search for a specific phrase and this can
				be controlled by surrounding the phrase within double quotes e.g. to
				search for breast cancer you can use:
				<code>"breast cancer"</code>
				. This will make sure that your results match your query entirely as
				adjacent words in the result, rather than matching just part of it
				or matching it at different parts of the result.
			</p>

			<h4>Boolean queries</h4>
			<p>Each word in the query is treated as a separate term (unless
				surrounded by double quotes) and by default a result only has to
				contain one of the terms.</p>
			<p>
				This behaviour can be modified by using boolean operators (AND OR
				NOT) and round brackets e.g. to find mouse or human samples that do
				not have leukmemia you can use:
				<code>NOT Leukemia AND ( mouse OR human )</code>
				.
			</p>

			<h4>Wildcards</h4>
			<p>
				Queries containing star or question mark characters are treated
				separately. A star character will match any combination of zero or
				more characters e.g.
				<code>leuk*mia</code>
				will match to leukemia and leukaemia as well as leukqwertymia. A
				question mark character will match any single characters e.g.
				<code>m?n</code>
				will match both man and men.
			</p>
			<p>
				For technical reasons, wildcards cannot be at the beginning of words
				e.g.
				<code>?ouse</code>
				.
			</p>

			<h4>Range queries</h4>
			<p>Certain attributes can be queried for ranges of matching
				values. For example for things that were last updated between the
				1st and 4th of April 2014.</p>
			<p>Attributes that can be searched using ranges are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Last update date e.g. <code>updatedate:[2014-04-01
						TO 2014-04-04]</code></li>
				<li>Release date e.g. <code>releasedate:[2014-04-01 TO
						2014-04-04]</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Please note that the date syntax is yyyy-MM-dd, a double digit
				month and day is required to satisfy the query syntax.</p>
