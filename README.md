= Biosamples Web

This is the updated version of the Biosamples Web user interface (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples).  
The older version is in the Biosd-ui repository (https://github.com/EBIBioSamples/biosd_ui).
 
This new, updated version is designed to work with a Solr index as it's back-end and features simplified view technology (now using Thymeleaf instead of a combination of JSP/XSTL), but otherwise looks essentially identical and is backwards compatible.

This is also designed to be portable and reskinnable for developing project-specific (or data specific) views on Biosamples data.
