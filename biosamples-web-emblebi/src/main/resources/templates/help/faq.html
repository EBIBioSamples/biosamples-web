					<p>BioSample accessions always begin with SAM. The next letter
						is either E or N depending if the sample information was
						originally submitted to EBI or NCBI respectively. After that,
						there may be an A or a G to denote an Assay sample or a Group of
						samples. Finally there is a numeric component that may or may not
						be zero-padded.</p>
