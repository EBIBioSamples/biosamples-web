			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
			<p>
				If you cannot find the answer to your question in this FAQ or the <a
					th:href="@{/help}" href="index.html">BioSamples Database help
					pages</a> then please email us at <a href="mailto:biosamples@ebi.ac.uk">biosamples@ebi.ac.uk</a>.

					<h3>How frequent are updates to BioSamples?</h3>
					<p>BioSamples content is updated daily. Information directly
						submitted or updated in a source should be reflected within 48
						hours. However, occasionally daily updates may be missed due to
						unexpected circumstances.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>What pattern do BioSamples accessions follow?</h3>
					<p>BioSample accessions always begin with SAM. The next letter
						is either E or N depending if the sample information was
						originally submitted to EBI or NCBI respectively. After that,
						there may be an A or a G to denote an Assay sample or a Group of
						samples. Finally there is a numeric component that may or may not
						be zero-padded.</p>

					<h3>Why do some of my search results not contain my query?</h3>
					<p>
						We use ontologies to help refine search queries. This means that
						your query might match to data a synonym or more specific term
						than you were looking for; e.g. a search for <code>human</code> will match <code>homo sapiens</code>. Usually a direct match will be ranked higher in the results however.
					</p>
				</li>

					<h3>I think some of the data is wrong. Can you fix it?</h3>
					<p>Most of the data in BioSamples has been submitted by third
						parties, often via one or more other services. This means that we
						are unable to go back to submitters for corrections or
						clarifications. Therefore we do not have the same degree of up
						front quality control as services with specific curators and
						submission requirements. We do however try to extract the highest
						quality of information from the data we are give, for example by
						mapping to ontologies and using ontology expansion for queries.</p>
