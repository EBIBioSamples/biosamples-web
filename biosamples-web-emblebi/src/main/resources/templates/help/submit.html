			<h2>What is a BioSample?</h2>
			<p>The definition of a BioSample is deliberately flexible in
				order to accommodate a wide range of uses. Typically each BioSample
				corresponds to a discrete physical object that is composed of live
				biological material.</p>
			<p>In most cases BioSample entities are self-evident; such as a
				blood sample, cell culture or an individual organism. However, a
				BioSample can also be an environmental sample (e.g. for meta-genomic
				analysis), a hybrid between two species, parasite infected cell
				culture, etc.</p>

			<h3>How are BioSamples described?</h3>

			<p>
				The basic structure for describing BioSamples is an <em>attribute</em>
				which is composed of a <em>key</em> and a <em>value</em> (a
				key/value pair), as well as optional modifiers.
			</p>
			<p>
				A BioSample is described by a set of attributes. BioSamples may be
				collected together into one or more <em>Groups(s)</em>, which may
				also have attributes.
			</p>
			<p>A SampleTab file contains BioSamples, any Groups containing
				them, and the attributes describing those BioSamples and Groups. A
				SampleTab file also contains general information, such as contact
				information and any publications related to the BioSamples.</p>
			<p>
				<em>Some key/value pairs examples:</em>
			</p>
			<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="30%">
				<colgroup>
					<col>
					<col>
				</colgroup>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Key</th>
						<th>Value</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Organism</td>
						<td>Homo sapiens</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Sex</td>
						<td>Female</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cell Type</td>
						<td>Fibroblast</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Race</td>
						<td>Caucasian</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<h2>What should be submitted to BioSamples Database?</h2>
			<p>
				The BioSamples Database is a suitable repository for pre-registering
				multi-omic submissions (e.g. <a href="//www.hipsci.org/">http://www.hipsci.org/</a>).
			</p>
			<p>Samples that do not have associated data in other EBI
				databases may also be suitable for submission.</p>
			<p>
				When submitting to other EBI databases (e.g. <a
					href="//www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/">ENA</a> or <a
					href="//www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/">ArrayExpress</a>), please note
				that these share sample information with BioSamples Database.
				Therefore sample information from submitters may be present in
				BioSamples Database even if the information was not submitted
				directly to BioSamples Database.
			</p>


			<h2>How to submit BioSamples Database?</h2>
			<p>
				Submissions to BioSamples Database should be in <a
					th:href="@{/help/st.html}" href="st.html">SampleTab file format</a>.
				This is a tab-separated spreadsheet-like text format compatible with
				popular office tools.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once you have a SampleTab file, you can use the <a
					th:href="@{/sampletab/validation.html}"
					href="/biosamples/sampletab/validation.html">online validation
					service</a> to ensure it is correct. This will also apply common
				corrections and ontology mappings that are used to standardise the
				data.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can send the validated and corrected SampleTab file by email to
				<a href="mailto:biosamples@ebi.ac.uk">biosamples@ebi.ac.uk</a>. We
				aim to respond to submissions within one working day.
			</p>

			<h3>Web Services</h3>
			<p>There are several services provided for programmatically
				sending sample information to the BioSamples Database. These are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a th:href="@{/sampletab/submission.html}"
					href="/biosamples/sampletab/submission.html">Submission service</a>
					for submitting SampleTab files. Please note that they will not be
					immediately visible in the web interface, but the assigned
					accession will be returned immediately as a SampleTab file after
					the submission.</li>
				<li><a th:href="@{/sampletab/validation.html}"
					href="/biosamples/sampletab/validation.html">Validation service</a>
					for validating SampleTab files without submitting them.</li>
				<li><a th:href="@{/sampletab/accession.html}"
					href="/biosamples/sampletab/accession.html">Accessioning
						service</a> for assigning accessions to samples and groups. Please
					note that this does not submit any sample information to the
					database, but will return the assigned accessions immediately.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				If you have any questions about these services or would like more
				information, please contact us at <a
					href="mailto:biosamples@ebi.ac.uk?Subject=SampleTab+Web+Services">biosamples@ebi.ac.uk</a>.
