			<h2>SampleTab file format</h2>

			<p>The BioSamples Database uses the SampleTab file format for
				submissions. This is a tab-delimited file that can be created in
				many spreadsheet editing software packages (e.g. Microsoft Excel).
				Although SampleTab files can have some advanced features, they can
				be written by users from a wide range of backgrounds using tools
				they are already familiar with.</p>

			<p>The SampleTab format has a number of advanced features for
				power users, such as ontology mappings, anonymous groups, and UTF-8
				character encoding.</p>

			<p>
				SampleTab files are composed of two section - <a
					th:href="@{/help/st_msi}" href="st_msi.html">MSI</a> and <a
					th:href="@{/help/st_scd}" href="st_scd.html">SCD</a>. In general,
				the following rules apply to SampleTab files:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Dates and times should be in ISO 8601 format to an
					appropriate level of accuracy i.e. YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.ss</li>
				<li>US English spellings should be used, and abbreviations are
					discouraged.</li>
				<li>Filenames should end with .txt</li>
				<li>Cells are tab separated and only tab separated. Tabs should
					not be within cells, even if quoted or escaped.</li>
				<li>If a data cell is empty and data for that tag is optional,
					then it is assumed that no data is provided for that cell for that
					tag. If data must be provided but is missing, the file is invalid.</li>
				<li>Within a cell leading and trailing whitespace is stripped.
					Empty cells at the end of a line are also stripped. Line endings
					can be in any format (Windows, Linux, Mac) but Linux line endings
					(LF) are preferred. New line characters must not be in any field,
					even if quoted/escaped. The presence of such character could
					prevent the submission of the SampleTab.</li>
				<li>Empty lines are ignored, including lines composed only of
					whitespace (inc tabs)</li>
				<li>If a cell is started and terminated with double quotes,
					they may be stripped.</li>
				<li>If the first character on a line is #, then that line is
					ignored. Use of # characters elsewhere is allowed, but discouraged.
				</li>
				<li>The use of only alphanumeric characters (upper and
					lowercase A-Z and 0-9, no accents or other symbols) is preferred.</li>
				<li>Files should be UTF-8 encoded.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Example SampleTab files</h3>

			<p>
				SampleTab files for all BioSamples are available from the <a
					href="ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/biosamples/">FTP site</a>,
				sorted by source. A specific example used in the screenshots in the
				following sections is <a
					href="ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/biosamples/coriell/GCR-niaid/sampletab.txt">this
					SampleTab file</a>.
