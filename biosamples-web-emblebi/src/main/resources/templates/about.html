        <h3 class="icon icon-generic" data-icon="i">What is BioSamples?</h3>
        <p class="justify">The BioSamples database aggregates sample information for reference samples e.g. Coriell Cell lines and samples for which data exist in one of the EBI's assay databases such as ArrayExpress, the European Nucleotide Archive, or PRIDE. It provides links to assays for specific samples, and accepts direct submissions of samples.</p>
